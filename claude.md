# Project: VAgeWell Care — Module 1
> Standalone mobile PWA built to `requirements.txt`. NOT run through the global 13-step pipeline
> (per user direction: build to the requirements file, don't force the org CLAUDE.md ceremony).

## Architecture (locked)
- **Supabase-native**, no backend service. Next.js 16 PWA ↔ Supabase (Auth · Postgres+RLS · Storage · Edge Fn).
- Auth: phone + 6-digit SMS OTP, `auth.uid()`, RLS, 72h session.
- Admin booking notification (R3.4): **removed** (user, 2026-07-21). No email / edge fn — the payment
  proof lands in the private `payment-proofs` bucket and the admin reviews & clears it from the dashboard.
- Excel export: client-side (browser).
- Roles: `patient` / `staff` / `admin` (spec's `leaf_node` ≡ `staff`).

## Dropped (not in requirements)
Shared Feedback system · shared `employees`/`apps` auth · `model_configs`/LLM-admin screens ·
Redux Toolkit · Cloud-Run/pipeline mandate. (Design system UI kit is kept — genuinely reusable.)

## Decisions log
- **CF-1 → RESOLVED:** Supabase Auth (phone+OTP+RLS), NOT shared employees/apps. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **Backend → RESOLVED:** Supabase-native; export client-side. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **GO-2 (channel) → SUPERSEDED:** was Email (Resend/SendGrid); admin notification removed entirely. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **R3.4 email alert → REMOVED:** deleted the `notify-admin` edge fn, DB webhook, config block, all
  email/webhook env vars, and the `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` / `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` constants. Admin reviews the
  uploaded proof + clears payment from the dashboard (pull-based, not push). (user, 2026-07-21)
- **GO-3 (roles) → RESOLVED:** patient/staff/admin. (user, 2026-07-21)

## Open items (defaults folded in — adjustable, do NOT treat as final)
- **GO-1** service catalog: 4 services. Physio Therapy ₹1,500 confirmed by the client (2026-07-24, migration
  0007). Nutrition / Para-Medical / Mental Wellbeing ₹800 still unconfirmed. One service per booking.
- **GO-4** OTP expiry/resend limits: Supabase defaults; dev fixed test codes in `config.toml`.
- **GO-5** rejection flow: rejected proof → `pending` (re-upload). Private bucket, 5 MB, png/jpg/webp.
- **GO-6** multi-day = consecutive (`start_date` + `num_days`).
- **GO-7** dependents: no hard cap; required Name/Age/Relationship/Contact.

## Build status — ALL PHASES COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 0 — scaffold, config, PWA, hygiene
- [x] Phase 1 — shared contract + schema + seed
- [x] Phase 2 — functions/triggers, RLS+grants, storage
- [x] Phase 3 — notify-admin edge function + webhook template  *(later REMOVED per user — R3.4 dropped)*
- [x] Phase 4 — frontend shell + DS + PWA
- [x] Phases 5–12 — all 8 screens + modals
- [x] Phase 13 — typecheck (0 errors) + production build (green) + security scan

## Verified locally
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors. `next build` → all 10 routes compile & prerender.
- Secret scan: no service-role/secret in frontend; only NEXT_PUBLIC URL+ANON_KEY exposed.

## NOT runnable in this env (needs user action)
- No Docker / Postgres here → migrations + RLS + OTP + storage NOT executed. Run `supabase start`
  + `supabase db reset` on a machine with Docker, or link a hosted Supabase project.

## Known deferrals (documented, not blockers)
- Services catalog is seeded + DB/Studio-editable (RLS `svc_write_admin` supports a future admin UI);
  no dedicated Services-admin screen (not in the 8-screen PDF).
- `middleware.ts` works but Next 16 deprecates the name in favour of `proxy.ts` (warning only).
- Fixed a schema bug during build: `chk_method_status` now allows `direct → paid` (cash at visit).

## Post-build audit remediation (2 deep audits: frontend + data layer)
Audit verdict: fully wired, no stubs/mock/dead buttons; transactional core verified correct. Fixed:
- [x] BUG: `useMyBookings` now filters `.eq(account_id, uid)` (staff tab was showing all bookings).
- [x] Added missing CHECK constraints on `how_heard` + `relationship` (were bare text).
- [x] Bounded `num_days` (1–60) and `time_slot` (06:00–21:00) at the DB.
- [x] R3.5 server-side gate: booking snapshot trigger rejects insert if profile has no `full_name`.
- [x] Freeze `payment_proof_path` once `payment_status='paid'` (no post-settlement swaps).
- [x] Secured `notify-admin` edge fn with `x-webhook-secret` (NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET) + empty-key dev fallback.
      *(superseded 2026-07-21 — the entire notify-admin email feature was later removed.)*
- [x] Pruned dead code (useBooking, loginSchema, paymentSchema, titleCase, BookingAlertPayload, unused import).
Re-verified: `tsc` 0 errors, `next build` green, secret scan clean, 0 dangling refs.

## Change round — admin + patient updates (user, 2026-07-22)
Implemented against `tsc` (0 errors). Metro/DB run + `0006` migration still pending on the user's machine.
- [x] **Services catalog swapped** → 4 services: Nutrition ₹800, Physio Therapy ₹1200, Para-Medical ₹800,
      Mental Wellbeing ₹800. New `supabase/migrations/0006_services_catalog.sql` deactivates the old 6
      (bookings.service_id is ON DELETE RESTRICT — can't delete) + upserts the 4. Mirrored in
      `supabase/seed.sql`, `supabase/install_all.sql`, and `SEED_SERVICES` in `shared/src/constants.ts`.
      **Requires applying 0006 (or `db reset`) on Supabase — not run in this env.**
- [x] **CSV/Excel download fixed on web** — `mobile/src/lib/export.ts` was native-only (expo-file-system +
      expo-sharing no-op on web → silent no-download). Added a `Platform.OS === "web"` Blob+anchor branch
      (DOM reached via `globalThis as any`); generalized `downloadSheet(rows, bookType, sheet, fileBase)`.
- [x] **DateField** rewritten as an in-app month-calendar `Modal` (was `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`,
      which doesn't render on web). Same props → DOB (ProfileScreen) + appointment start_date unchanged.
      Package still installed but no longer imported in code.
- [x] **Admin Payment Proofs module** — `mobile/src/screens/admin/AdminPaymentProofsScreen.tsx` (name +
      screenshot thumbnail, batch-signed URLs; taps open the existing `PaymentReviewModal`). Registered in
      `AdminNavigator` + `AdminStackParamList`; dashboard button added.
- [x] **Live Sheet = Medical records** — `useAllClinicalRecords` (shared) + Appointments/Medical toggle on
      `LiveSheetScreen` + `exportClinicalToCSV`. Staff RLS `clin_select` already permits reading all rows.
- [x] **Vitals entry gated to Para-Medical** — `AdminBookingCard` shows the "Vitals" action only when
      `service_name === PARA_MEDICAL_SERVICE`.
- [x] **Patient Health record trimmed** — `VitalsView` now shows only Sugar (glucose) + Blood Group tiles;
      history collapses to those two, drops empty "Record" rows, keeps the date. (BP/SpO2/conditions hidden.)
- **Not changed (clarified with user):** Role dropdown kept in `AdminPatientProfileScreen` (item 3); admin
      member-edit medical section kept (item 6 — the admin *profile* screen already shows no health record).

## Change round — client feedback PDF (user, 2026-07-24)
Source: `VAgeWell Care - Feedback Notes (1).pdf`. Verified with `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) **and**
`expo export --platform web` (bundle green, logo + favicon emitted). **`0007` migration still pending
on the user's Supabase.**
- [x] **New logo** — `mobile/assets/logo.png` (client-supplied, 300×282, opaque white bg). New
      `ui/BrandLogo.tsx` renders it in a white rounded chip (the chip absorbs the baked-in white
      background — no keying, no matte fringe). Replaces the HeartPulse chip on Landing/Login/Register;
      also `app.json` `icon` + `web.favicon`. *Known cosmetic debt: source is non-square and < 1024px,
      so the app icon is padded/soft. Swapping in a 1024px square export is a one-file replacement.*
- [x] **Brand mark colour swapped** — Landing now reads `VAgeWell` teal + `CARE` black (was inverse).
- [x] **Copy** — Register subtitle "Your Care Journey Starts Here", name placeholder "Name", label "Age";
      Login "Together, We Move Towards Better Health."; Admin login "Together, we manage care, support
      people, and create a healthier future"; Services "Our services" / "Choose a service to begin your
      care journey."; Appointment "Request Personalized Care"; Appointments subtitle "Your Bookings";
      booking cards read `Patient <name>` (name in brand teal) on both patient + admin sides.
- [x] **Physio Therapy ₹1,200 → ₹1,500** — new `supabase/migrations/0007_physio_price.sql` (idempotent).
      Mirrored in `seed.sql`, `install_all.sql` (its services block is now an **upsert**, not
      `do nothing`, so re-running it repairs a stale catalog) and `SEED_SERVICES`. `0006` left untouched
      — it may already be applied; 0007 supersedes it. Existing bookings keep ₹1,200 (price is snapshotted).
- [x] **Booking completion added** — `useCompleteBooking()` (open → closed) + a **Complete** action on
      `AdminBookingCard`. No migration: the 0002 update guard and `bk_update` RLS already allowed staff
      `open → closed`; nothing in the UI had ever used it. `BOOKING_STATUS_META.closed` now labels
      "Completed" (was "Closed") to match the action.
- [x] **Patient Appointments** — only `open` bookings list; the most recent closed/cancelled one renders
      as a read-only **Last appointment** card (deliberately not `PatientBookingCard`, which carries
      Cancel/re-upload affordances).
- [x] **Admin Patients search now includes dependents** — new `useAllFamilyMembers(enabled)` +
      `qk.familyMembersAll`. Account holders and family members share one name-sorted, searchable list;
      dependents carry a "Family member" pill and tap straight through to `AdminMemberEdit`.
- [x] **Live sheet merged into one sheet** — Appointments/Medical toggle removed. `liveSheetRows()`
      in `mobile/src/lib/export.ts` emits the client's 18 columns + Booking ID / Symptom Brief / Created.
      Vitals are folded per subject taking the **most recent non-null value per field** (staff write one
      dated row per visit, so `records[0]` alone would blank earlier fields). Payment/appointment status
      use the human labels. Both the CSV download and the dashboard Excel export now call the same
      builder, so they are byte-identical.
- [x] **Profile** — vitals History list removed; Sugar + Blood Group tiles kept.
- **Cascade cleanup:** `clinicalRows` / `exportClinicalToCSV` / `ClinicalRecordWithNames` deleted;
      `useAllClinicalRecords` dropped its 3-way name join (nothing consumed it once the medical sheet
      went); `useAllBookings` gained `relationship / age / contact_phone` on the dependent embed and
      `age` on the account embed.

### Re-check pass (same day) — 4 issues found and fixed
- **`0007_physio_price.sql` was written empty** (0 bytes of SQL). Rewritten + content verified. *Lesson:
  read back any generated file that nothing else compiles or imports — `tsc` can't catch an empty .sql.*
- **`install_all.sql` upsert didn't retire the old catalog.** As a repair script it would have left the
  original 6 placeholder services active alongside the new 4. Now does `set active = false` first,
  matching 0006.
- **Profile tiles could blank a known value.** With History gone, `records[0]` was the only source — a
  visit that recorded sugar but not blood group hid a blood group captured earlier. `VitalsView` now
  reads the most recent **non-null value per field**, same rule as the live sheet.
- **Dashboard fetched the whole vitals ledger on every load** just to arm the Export button. Now
  `useAllClinicalRecords(false)` + `refetch()` on click (verified in query-core: `refetch()` calls
  `fetch()` with no `enabled` gate). Also fixed the patient empty state, which said "No appointments
  yet" to someone whose visits were merely finished.

## Change round — client feedback Doc2.pdf (user, 2026-07-24)
Six notes on admin dashboard / patient Appointments / live sheet. Verified `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors)
and `expo export --platform web` (bundle green). **`0008` migration pending on the user's Supabase.**
- [x] **Cancelled bookings are out of the payment workflow.** `AdminBookingCard` drops the **Review**
      action and the payment pill when `booking_status === 'cancelled'` (a cancelled visit showing
      "Pay at Visit" was the client's complaint); the divider row is skipped when no actions remain.
      `PaymentReviewModal` renders read-only for a cancelled booking — the proof image stays, the
      Reject / Mark Paid pair becomes a notice + Close. That matters because the modal is *also*
      opened from `AdminPaymentProofsScreen`, so gating the card alone left a second path.
      New `supabase/migrations/0008_cancelled_payment_guard.sql` closes the same hole in the DB:
      0002's `verify_payment` / `reject_payment` gated on `payment_status` only, so a cancelled
      booking could still be settled. Mirrored into `install_all.sql`. `create or replace` preserves
      the 0002 ACLs, so the revoke/grant block is not repeated.
- [x] **Dashboard ordered by appointment date desc** — `useAllBookings` ordered `created_at desc`
      while every card/sheet row renders `start_date`, so the visible dates looked unsorted. Now
      `.order(start_date desc).order(created_at desc)`. Intentional cascade: payment proofs, live
      sheet and both exports are newest-appointment-first too.
- [x] **Dashboard search covers services** — `filtered` also matches `service_name`; label is now
      "Search by patient or service".
- [x] **Last appointment = completed only** — `DashboardScreen` took every non-open booking, so a
      *cancelled* one could headline "Last appointment". Narrowed to `booking_status === 'closed'`;
      cancelled bookings now leave the patient's tab entirely (confirmed with the user). Empty state
      keys off `hasAny` rather than `last`, so anyone who has ever booked reads "No upcoming".
- [x] **Back control between Appointment and Payment** — the patient tabs run `headerShown: false`
      and `PageHeader` had no back slot, so Payment was a dead end on web/PWA and iOS. `PageHeader`
      gained an optional `onBack` (ChevronLeft, mirrors `AdminHeader`); wired on Payment and, for the
      same dead end, Appointment. **Payment suppresses it while `busy` and once `createdId` is set** —
      the booking row already exists at that point (insert OK, proof upload failed), and a second pass
      through a freshly-mounted PaymentScreen would insert a duplicate.
- [x] **Live sheet search over all data** — `FormInput` + a "Showing N of M rows" counter; the filter
      matches each row's whole value set as text, so it covers every column including Booking ID and
      Symptom Brief. `exportAppointmentsToCSV` couldn't see the filter (it re-derived rows from
      `bookings`), so it was replaced by `exportRowsToCSV(rows)` taking pre-built rows; the button
      downloads exactly what's listed and is disabled on an empty result. Dashboard **Export** is
      untouched and still exports everything.
- [x] **New logo** — client's Photoroom cutout (395×418, real alpha) replaces `mobile/assets/logo.png`
      and the repo-root source copy. Because the mark is now transparent, a transparent app icon would
      render black-backed on iOS, so `app.json` `icon` points at a **new generated
      `mobile/assets/icon.png`** — 1024×1024, mark centred at 78% on white. That also clears the old
      "icon is padded/soft" debt. `web.favicon` stays on the transparent `logo.png` (adapts to the tab
      background). `BrandLogo`'s white chip is kept as a deliberate badge; its comment no longer
      claims the source has a baked-in white background.

## Bugfix — "Save profile goes to an undefined page" (user, 2026-07-24)
Patient **Profile → Edit details → Save** on the web/PWA: browser tab title flipped to the literal
string `undefined`, splash flashed, user was dumped on the Services tab. Frontend-only, no migration.
Verified `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) + `expo export --platform web` (bundle green).

Root cause chain (verified against the installed `@react-navigation` v7 source, not from memory):
`saveBio` → `refreshProfile()` → `AuthProvider.loadProfile()` sets the **global** `profileLoading`
→ `RootNavigator`'s gate `if (loading || (user && profileLoading))` returned `<SplashScreen/>`,
unmounting the whole navigator. Two symptoms fell out of that one unmount:
1. `AppNavigator` remounted **fresh**, so the tab stack rebuilt from scratch and landed on the
   initial route (`ServicesTab`) — the "thrown off Profile" half.
2. With no navigator mounted, `NavigationContainer` still runs `useDocumentTitle`; its default
   formatter is `options?.title ?? route?.name` and `getCurrentRoute()` returns `undefined`
   (`BaseNavigationContainer.js`: `state == null → undefined`), so it executed
   `document.title = undefined` → the tab literally read **"undefined"**. The "undefined page" half.

- [x] **`RootNavigator`: gate the splash on *resolution*, not on *loading*.** Now
      `profileResolved = !!profile && profile.id === user?.id`, and the splash only shows while the
      **current** user's profile is still unknown. Keeps the original anti-flicker intent (patient
      shell must not flash before the role resolves) but a background refetch no longer tears down
      the tree. Keyed on `profile.id === user.id` rather than a bare `!profile` so a stale profile
      from a previous account can't count as resolved when a different-role account signs in.
- [x] **`App.tsx`: explicit `documentTitle` formatter** — `options?.title ?? "VAgeWell Care"`.
      Belt-and-braces: the splash is still legitimately rendered on cold start and sign-out, and
      both wrote `undefined` before. Also stops internal route ids (`AdminMemberEdit`) leaking into
      the browser tab/history. Keep the string in sync with `expo.name` in `app.json` by eye.
- [x] **`ProfileScreen.saveBio`**: `setEditing(false)` now runs *before* `void refreshProfile()`
      instead of awaiting it — polish, so the read-only rows appear without a second round-trip.
- **Wider fix, same root cause:** Supabase fires `onAuthStateChange` on `TOKEN_REFRESHED` (~hourly)
  and `AuthProvider` re-ran `loadProfile` there too, so the app used to remount and reset to the
  initial tab mid-session on a routine token refresh. That is gone as well.
- **Deliberately not touched:** `AdminMemberEditScreen.save()` — it never calls `refreshProfile`, so
  it cannot hit this bug (confirmed with the user that the admin path is not the reported symptom).
  It does carry a separate latent issue worth its own round: `finish()` (toast + `goBack()`) fires
  off the **clinical** mutation only, so a failed *bio* update still reports "Record saved".

## Context handoff
Latest: the **"Save profile → undefined page" bugfix** (2026-07-24) is implemented — `tsc --noEmit`
0 errors, web bundle green. Frontend-only, no migration, so it needs **no DB work** — just a runtime
click-through on the web build: Profile → Edit details → Save must keep the tab title
"VAgeWell Care" (never "undefined"), stay mounted on the Profile tab with the form collapsed to the
updated read-only rows, and no splash flash. Regression to re-check: hard-reload as a patient **and**
as a staff/admin account — the splash must still hold until the role resolves, with no flicker of
the patient tabs before the admin stack appears.

Doc2.pdf feedback round (2026-07-24) is implemented — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, web bundle green, the
new logo + generated icon bundle correctly. **Needs the user's machine:**
1. Apply `supabase/migrations/0006` (if never run), `0007_physio_price.sql` **and the new
   `0008_cancelled_payment_guard.sql`** — or `supabase db reset`.
   Verify: `select name, price_per_day from services where active` → Physio Therapy = 1500; then cancel
   a booking and call `select verify_payment('<id>')` → must raise *"booking is cancelled"* with
   `payment_status` unchanged.
2. Runtime click-through (no Docker/Postgres in the build env): cancelled card shows only the
   `Cancelled` pill with no Review; dashboard lists newest appointment date first; searching "physio"
   filters by service; live-sheet search + CSV row count; the back chevron returns from Payment to a
   still-filled Appointment form; admin **Complete** → booking leaves the patient list and reappears
   as *Last appointment*, while a cancelled one disappears.
3. The client's original `WhatsApp Image 2026-07-24 at 14.27.26-Photoroom.png` is still sitting in the
   repo root — delete it if you don't want the raw drop kept alongside `logo.png`.

Earlier context still current: **R3.4 admin email alert removed (2026-07-21)** — the `notify-admin`
edge fn, `supabase/webhooks.sql`, its config block, all email/webhook env vars and the
`ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` / `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` constants are deleted; the admin reviews the uploaded proof
and clears payment from the dashboard instead. To run: follow README (supabase start → db reset →
`npm run start` in `mobile/`). Confirm the founding-admin phone in `supabase/seed.sql`.
GO-1 is now settled for Physio (₹1,500); GO-4/5/6/7 still carry documented defaults — confirm before
production. Known non-blocker: `AdminPatientProfileScreen` has one dead `Card` import (pre-existing,
left alone under the minimal-impact rule).
